***Rest API Design in Spring Boot, using Java Enterprise Edition specifications such as JPA(provided by Hibernate),
JMS, and Spring Validator for Validation.***

This project is about designing the API for Application Form. Application Form is an Application Management Tool which allows humans to apply for the 
                           "Job application" and User Register.

In application-form, users are able to:
- List his/her applications 
- Create a new application
- The application process has those steps
    - Step 1: Add a CV
    - Step 2: Add personal details
    - Step 3: Write an essay
    - Step 4: Summary showing data from the previous steps in a read-only form
- Submit an application
- Delete an application
 

The API is dependent on Project Lombok. The usage of this dependency is to reduce the amount of boilerplate code that 
may be generated by a developer such as constructors, getters, setters, equals/hashCode and ToString.

This project uses the ORM relations between entities.

The database that is used in this project is MySql 8.0 Database.
